# Project Idea

- Planning to make a fixed interest bonds project
- Users can deposit money for certain number of months and earn interest
- Contract owner can setup the bond and the interest rates
- Complete withdrawal of amount before time period will result in no interest
- Contract owner has to fund the contract with rewards for users
- Deposit and Reward will both be the same ERC20 token
- Partial Withdraw not allowed

# Project Structure

- `contract` folder contains Ethereum contracts written in Solidity
- `frontend` folder contains user interface written in React
- `avoiding_common_attacks.md` describes security measures
- `deployed_address.txt` contains the testnet address and network where contracts have been deployed
- `design_pattern_decisions.md` describes design patterns
